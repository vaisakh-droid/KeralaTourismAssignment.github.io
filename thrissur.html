                    <p>Thrissur , formerly Trichur, also known by its historical name Thrisshivaperur, is a city and the headquarters of the Thrissur district in Kerala, India. It is the third largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India.The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats a large Hindu temple. It is located 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Trivandrum. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, and was a point of contact for Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and the English.

                        Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history. It contains the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy, Kerala Lalithakala Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Academy.[6] The city hosts the Thrissur Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple festival in Kerala. The festival is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan in April or May, in the Malayalam month 'medam'.[5]
                        
                        Religion is important and varied in Thrissur. The city has historically been a centre of Hindu scholarship, and Christianity, Islam and Judaism are believed to have entered the Indian subcontinent through Thrissur and its surrounding areas. Thrissur has a large number of well-known temples including the Vadakkumnathan temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple, Paramekkavu temple, and Guruvayur temple. There are two major Catholic churches, the Our Lady of Lourdes Syro-Malabar Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral and Our Lady of Dolours Syro-Malabar Catholic Basilica, the largest Christian church in India.[9] India's first mosque, Cheraman Juma Masjid, is believed to have been constructed in 629 CE.[10][11][12]
                        
                        The city is the headquarters of four major scheduled banks, South Indian Bank Ltd, Catholic Syrian Bank, Dhanalakshmi Bank and ESAF Small Finance Bank as well as several chit funds.[14] The city is also a big centre for silks and gold jewellery. Thrissur attracts the largest number of domestic tourists in Kerala.</p>
